Charles Babbage
In 1821 an inventor and mathematician, Charles Babbage, was poring over a set of mathematical tables. 
Finding error after error Babbage exclaimed, "I wish to God these calculations had been executed by steam." 
His frustration was not simply at the grindingly tedious labor of checking manually evaluated tables, but at their daunting unreliability. 
Science, engineering, construction, banking, and insurance depended on tables for calculation. 
Ships navigating by the stars relied on them to find their positions at sea.
